1) Update Core Mechanics and combinations
	Core Mechanics
		Gather ingredients
		Jump, walk, walk off edges
		Jumping on/pushing against environment pieces may cause a change
		Some objects are, like the player, alive
		
2) Update Key Events (enemy and environmental interactions)
	Key Events
		Leading an enemy to knock one ingredient off shelf
		Pushing a jar off shelf to reveal ingredient inside
		Landing on bed/rug to get highest ingredients without dying
		Rocking a chair with jumps to get ingredient under rocker-rail
		
3) Show Gameplay blocks with flow
	Gameplay blocks
		Ingredients that can be accessed easily will cause death if not approached properly
		Enemies are essentially environment which can be "activated", for good or bad
		Jumps must be carefully planned
			A jump from equal levels is safe
			A fall from a higher level to a lower level is safe
			A jump from a higher level to a lower level causes damage
			A fall from the highest level to the ground floor causes damage
			A jump from the highest level to the ground floor causes severe damage
			
3) Emotions for Gameplay Blocks
	Emotions
		Hesitation
			Enemies are disguised as common objects
			Jumps must be planned carefully in some situations
		Assumption/Ah-Ha Moments
			Ingredients will often seem obvious to retrieve, but has a catch
			Figuring out what needs to change in the obvious solution
		Dissociation
			The player-character scale is about the size of a mouse
			This means tables are terrifying to look over in 1st person
			
4) Distribution of Ingredients
	Ingredients in this case may be confusing, since "ingredients" are a thing in this game
	These collectables are distributed as 2 parts obvious, 1 part hidden, 1 part "puzzle"
	The environment contains objects that are out of scale
		In relation to the player
		In relation to itself (a giant ladle, for example)
